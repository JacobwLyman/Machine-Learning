## This Project

Recommending the right questions for a programmer to solve is a big challenge for online education platforms. Nevertheless, this is essential to keep users engaged. 

Recommended questions should be ones that are within the skill level of a respective user. The question that this project will address is "For a given programmer, how much time will they take to solve a given problem?" To answer this question, I will build a model to make such predictions based on a programmer's historical platform interactions, their background, and the characteristics of a given problem. 

Knowing the expected time for a solution will provide insight as to which level of questions should be recommended to a user. The product of this project will serve as the basis for a recommendation engine, which will address a broader question of "What question(s) should be recommended to a programmer to keep them engaged?"
